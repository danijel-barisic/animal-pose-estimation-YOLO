# Animal pose estimation using YOLOv8

In this project, YOLOv8 model is used to estimate animal poses by identifying key points on animal bodies.
By applying deep learning and by analyzing those key points, model becomes capable of identifying poses on new images, with relative proficiency.

Data exploration and preparation is done in DataExploration.ipynb Jupyter notebook file. Train, validation and test sets are prepared.

YOLO model is trained in the ModelTraining.ipynb Jupyter notebook file.
